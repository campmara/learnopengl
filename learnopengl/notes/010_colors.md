# COLORS

Color is usually perceived in real life as a reflection of light on an object from a light-source (sun, lamps, etc.). The color you perceive is a result of that object absorbing colors from that light and reflecting the colors it actually is.

In graphics, color works similarly. The resulting color of an object is usually calculated as a component-wise multiplication of the color of the light and the color of the object, represented as a 3d vector.

> perceived color = light color * object color
